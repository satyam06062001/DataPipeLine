# 🏗️ Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline using Azure services—from raw data ingestion to real-time dashboarding in Power BI. It follows the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** architecture pattern for scalable and organized data processing.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To build a robust, automated, and scalable data pipeline leveraging Azure services that performs:
- Ingestion of raw CSV files
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Aggregation and analytics
- Dashboarding with actionable insights
